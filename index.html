                <p>In an ancient world which brimmed-full with fantastic, larger-than-life architecture 
                    and religious tradition, the glory of ancient Delphi stood out as a crown jewel of 
                    Greek culture. Delphi, considered during its heyday to be the geographical center of 
                    the world, was a place of peace and high religious ceremony. The main Sanctuary at Delphi 
                    was home of the Pythian Games, one of the four major international Greek games, where the 
                    best athletes in the Greek world would compete for the honor of their homelands. There also 
                    lived the oracles of Delphi, where kings and commoners alike would make pilgrimage to seek 
                    divine advice.

                <p>The leagues and kingdoms of the ancient Greek city-states would provide insurance for 
                    their diplomatic treaties by leaving some of their finest art and treasures, under 
                    lock-and-key, at Delphi. Each city state also had its own shrine to their patron-deities 
                    at Delphi, making it a truly international city. Citizens of all Greek nations were 
                    welcome to worship there, despite any contemporary warfare. Furthermore, women from 
                    anywhere in the Greek world could seek legal protection at Delphi by becoming employed 
                    there as a servant or priestess – if they needed to flee trouble at home. Today, Delphi 
                    is the location of some of the best-preserved ruins from classical Greece.

                <p>Beyond the mighty monuments, ornate sculpture, sophisticated artwork, and lavish ritual of 
                    Delphi, a single person would out-shine the rest of Delphi’s legacy. The Pythia was the 
                    title of the high priestess of Delphi, who also served as its primary oracle. The role of 
                    Pythia as spiritual leader of Delphi was established around 1000 B.C., outdating nearly all 
                    of Delphi’s architecture and other traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to the rest of the priestly class at Delphi, the Pythia would be selected for her 
                    powers of spiritual divination, and she was chosen from among the women of low-birth 
                    in the region. As high priestess, she was widely sought after by kings and commoners 
                    alike for her divine prophecies. The Oracle at Delphi was the most prestigious and 
                    authoritative oracle in classical Greek culture, and the Pythia of the Oracle of Delphi
                    was among the most powerful women of pre-Roman Europe.

                    of a temple at the location. According to ancient tradition, from sources including the 
                    ancient Greek poet Pindar, the first major temple at the location was likely actually to honor 
                    the Apollo’s sister, the Goddess Dimeter, and was likely made of olive wood and bee’s wax. 
                    After a succession of fires and earthquakes destroyed older versions of Delphi’s principal 
                    temple, the ultimate version of was commissioned by three major Greek city states, in accord

                    and adorned with imported marble statuary and frescos. Doric-style granite columns 
                    supported a solid-stone ceiling over 60 feet high, and the gable was likely pained 
                    white, blue, red, or gold at different times. The marble inner-sanctum of the temple was 
                    finished internally in elaborately carved olive wood, and was host to ceremonies which 
                    are still shrouded in mystery. Reconstructions by modern architects of what the Temple 
                    of Apollo at Delphi would have looked like when complete, including the long-destroyed 
                    40 foot tall bronze statue of Apollo to the East of the temple, illustrate how monumental 
                    the site was in its heyday.

                    constructed in the middle 4th Century B.C., as the crowning center of the Athena Pronaia 
                    temple, which was dedicated to the Goddess Athena.

                <p>The Tholos had 26 foot high Doric-style columns constructed of polished, local white granite. 
                    The exact contents of the frescos and carvings on the gable above the columns continues to 
                    be a hotly-debated topic among historians. Contemporary accounts describe highly detailed 
                    carvings of scenes of battle between the Hellenic Gods and their enemies, the infamous Titans
                    – alluding to the mythological purification of the Earth by the gods. Other accounts suggest 
                    scenes of battle between Amazon warriors and their enemies, or full-bodied statuary of heroes, 
                    or statuary of Athena herself. Sadly, the temple was so badly damaged that all we have of the 
                    original artwork is allegorical. The Tholos had a domed or dual-capulla roof, which 
                    contemporary sources agree was finished in layers of red clay tiles.

                <p>Similar to the agora (or marketplace), the theatre was an architectural hallmark of ancient 
                    Greek civilization, and theatres can be found in nearly every ancient Greek community. The 
                    theatre at Delphi was built further up the hill from the Temple of Apollo, giving spectators an 
                    unrivaled view of the rest of the sanctuary, and the valley below. Added to the sanctuary 
                    during the 4th Century B.C., the theatre was expanded and improved several times. The 
                    koilon (seating) leans against the natural slope of the mountain, and is assembled using 
                    local white granite. The stage would have been covered in sand from the nearby shoreline 
                    at the Gulf of Corinth, or swept clean, depending on the demands of the event.

                    ceremony, the sound of running water would have accompanied the verse and poetry being 
                    performed on stage. The theatre continued to be used under the Romans, long after the rest 
                    of the sanctuary had become obsolete, until probably the early 6th Century A.D..

                    alternative to competing exclusively on the battlefield! Delphi was host to the Pythian Games,

                    held at four-year intervals, offset by two years from each other.

                    season, the games were held in honor of the Pythia (high priestess) of Delphi, and the 
                    mythological victory of the Hellenic God Apollo over his enemies, the Titans, after a 
                    legendary battle at Delphi. Around 500 B.C., the Panhellenic Games became formalized into 
                    regular competitions with standard rules, and enjoyed wide international participation.

                <p>The Pythian Stadium started humbly as a mere clearing in the forest, but was improved over 
                    the centuries with koilon (seating) hewn from local granite, and an indoor gymnasium where 
                    the athletes could warm-up before competitions. Ornate stone carvings, bronze statues, 
                    embossed frescos, and other artwork depicting athletic competition and divine victory
                    (as described by contemporary witnesses) has sadly been lost to the ages.

                <p>Sporting events held in the Pythian games were foot-races (including 1 lap, 10 laps, 
                    and 20 laps of the stadium), wrestling, long jump, javelin throwing, archery, and discus. 
                    Unlike the original Olympic Games, the Pythian Games would have included both men’s 
                    and women’s events. The stadium at Delphi would have held some 2,000 spectators, and 
                    bronze trumpets would have sounded the opening and closing of each competition.
